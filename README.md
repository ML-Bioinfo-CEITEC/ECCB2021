This is a template for an easy publishing of your model. The code contains TODOs that will guide you through the journey of adding your own model. You can find the TODOs in `index.html` and `cifarCNN.js`. After you go through the code have a look at the GitHub pages guide for publishing the site in our slides or at https://pages.github.com/
